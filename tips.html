        <h2> (hopefully)helpful tips for your hand lettering!</h2>
      <h3> tip no. 1: </h3>
      be loose! if you're nervous of messing something up, don't worry about it! if you're really scared of messing something up, go ahead and use pencil first so you can always fix any mistakes, not that mistakes are bad AT ALL!
